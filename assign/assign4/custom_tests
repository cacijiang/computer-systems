# File: custom_tests
# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.
# Refer to the CS107 website for more information.
#
# Below are example custom tests, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.

# For the following five tests, I firstly test myls with "-a" flag on another folder.
# Then, it is tested without flag. The next test is to input an invalid path. Then
# I changed the path a bit to move one level back. The last test is to add "-z" flag.
myls -a /afs/ir/class/cs107/samples
myls /afs/.ir/users/c/a/cacikong/CS107/assign/assign4/tools
myls /afs/.ir/users/c/a/cacikong/CS107/assign/assign4s
myls /afs/.ir/users/c/a/cacikong/CS107/assign/assign4/..
myls -z /afs/.ir/users/c/a/cacikong/CS107/assign/assign4
# For the following four tests, firstly I test to see whether the key can be inserted
# at the last index as edge case. Secondly, it is tested for the key already at the
# last index. I also considered a case when the whole input list contains the same
# elements. Last case is to test string case.
test_binsert -i 8 3 2
test_binsert -i 8 3 2 8
test_binsert -i 5 4 4 4
test_binsert -s "ss" "sa" "se" "sz"
# For the following three tests, I tried mysort on a code file. Then I tried to add
# "-n" flag on string file. For the last case, if there are mutiple sorting rules,
# mysort should follow the latest input one.
mysort util.c
mysort -n samples/colors
mysort -r -n -l samples/names
