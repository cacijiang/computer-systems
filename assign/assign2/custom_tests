# File: custom_tests
# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.
# Refer to the "how to work on assignments" page on the course website for more information.
#
# Below are example custom tests, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.
#
# In addition to the tests in sanity check, I provided the following custom tests.
# For myprintenv.c, firstly I added a test for SSH_CONNECTION to see if it works for key
# containing "-". Then I added SSH_CLIENT and SSH_TTY to see if it works on two similar
# arguments together.The last test includes an invalid in the middle of two valid keys.
#
# For tokenize.c, in the first case, the input string only contains one of the delimiters.
# For the second test, I added additional argument for the size of buffer array, limiting it
# to 3. Then I tested some edge cases. The third test does not include token, while the fourth
# test does not include delimiter.
#
# For mywhich.c, the first test uses an invalid executable, while the second test mixes an
# invalid executable in a bunch of valid ones.
