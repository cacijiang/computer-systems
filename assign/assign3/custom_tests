# Refer to the page on working on assignments, linked to from the Assignments page,
# for more information.
#
# Below are example custom tests, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.

# For the following three tests, I simply test the three programs on the files
# provided in folder "samples".
mycat samples/names
mytail samples/colors
myuniq samples/colors
# For the following three tests, I test the three programs on my own added file. I add
# the words from some paragraphs of  one of my papers to make the custom text file,
# which is over 500 lines. In addtion, I call mycat.c on util.c to see whether it works
# on c program. I also specify the number of last lines when calling mytail.c.
mycat myfile.txt
mycat util.c
mytail -5 myfile.txt
myuniq myfile.txt
# For the following tests, I try to combine the programs together and also with other
# command line by using the pipeline. 
./mycat myfile.txt | wc -l
./mycat myfile.txt | ./mytail -9
./myuniq myfile.txt | ./mytail
