# File: custom_tests
# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.
# Each custom test is given on a single line using format:
#
#     executable  arg(s)
#
# The executable is the name of the program to run.
# The args are optional. If given, they are treated as a sequence of space-separated
# command-line arguments with which to invoke the executable program.
#
# For each custom test, sanity check will invoke your executable program and the
# solution program (using same command-line arguments), compare the two
# outputs to verify if they match, and report the outcome.
#
# Blank lines and comment lines beginning with # are ignored.
#
# Below is an example custom test, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.
