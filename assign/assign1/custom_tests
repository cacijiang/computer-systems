# ------------------
# This file contains a list of custom tests to be run by the sanity check tool.

# Below are example custom tests, you can edit this file to change or add new tests.
#
# For sat, I tested two edge cases for bit input which are 4 and 64, and I also include
# 16 to test the bit input in the range [4, 64]. For automata, I include the tests 
# to spread out the input ruleset over the range [0, 255], including the edge cases.
# For utf8, I tested the cases at each break point of the code points.
